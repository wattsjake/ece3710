This is a seven segment display driver for the 8051 microcontroller. This repo has two different programs currently. The first is a simple program that displays the number 0-9 on the seven segment display. The second program is a simple game that uses the seven segment display as a score counter. Make sure to select the desired program and load it to the build in Silicon Labs IDE, AND remove any residual programs from the build directory.
